How to take care of your emotions in a disturbing reality?\\xe2\\x80\\x99 was the topic of the last meeting of the semester in the series \\xe2\\x80\\x98What does science say? (Non-)academic meetings\\xe2\\x80\\x99 at the University of Gda\\xc5\\x84sk Museum. What can we do to take care of our well-being? What role do other people play in this, and what about the mysterious vagus nerve? Dr Agata Rudnik, psychologist and director of the Academic Psychological Support Centre at the University of Gda\\xc5\\x84sk, talked about ways to deal with difficult emotions in turbulent times.</strong></p>\\n<p>The June meeting in the series \\xe2\\x80\\x98What does science say? (Non-)academic meetings\\xe2\\x80\\x99 enjoyed exceptional attendance - additional seats had to be brought into the intimate temporary exhibition hall at the University of Gda\\xc5\\x84sk Museum. For some of the guests, this was not their first encounter with science in the form proposed by the UG Museum on the occasion of the university\\'s 55th anniversary. The idea behind the \\xe2\\x80\\x98(non)academic meetings\\xe2\\x80\\x99 was to bring science to the people and discuss current, important social issues.</p>\\n<p><em>\\xe2\\x80\\x98We would like to invite you to our discussion, so that it can be a safe space to talk about what is on our minds</em>,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 encouraged <strong>dr Agata Rudnik</strong> at the beginning of the meeting, referring to her own work in a hospital gastroenterology ward.</p>\\n<p>How to cope with a disturbing reality? First of all, it is worth remembering that the various negative emotions and reactions (e.g. anxiety, difficulty sleeping) we experience are completely natural. And what can we do to help ourselves?</p>\\n<h5><strong>Acceptance</strong></h5>\\n<p><em>\\xe2\\x80\\x98I feel that we devote a lot of time and energy to fighting something. To be better, smarter, earn more money</em>,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 noted dr Agata Rudnik. Meanwhile, fighting is not always the best choice at a given moment:</p>\\n<p><em>\\xe2\\x80\\x98Sometimes you have to accept something. We shouldn\\'t fight the fact that sometimes we feel sad or find things difficult, because sometimes we just have to go through it and we need it (...) If we didn\\'t experience stress, we wouldn\\'t even have left the cave. Stress can therefore be motivating and conducive to development - the problem arises when we experience it chronically.\\xe2\\x80\\x99</em></p>\\n<h5><strong>The intestines, the brain and the mysterious vagus nerve</strong></h5>\\n<p><em>\\xe2\\x80\\x98Imagine a fluffy kitten. You have as many neurons in your intestines as a cat has in its brain, so you really need to take care of what goes on in there.\\xe2\\x80\\x99</em></p>\\n<p>It is therefore worth taking care of your microbiome, the \\xe2\\x80\\x98good bacteria\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that perform protective functions. How can you do this? It is worth eating fermented foods and going for walks in the forest, because they allow us to absorb beneficial microorganisms from the air.</p>\\n<p>It is also worth remembering the vagus nerve. It is the tenth cranial nerve, which connects the brain to the intestines (among other things) and is responsible for the \\xe2\\x80\\x98chill\\xe2\\x80\\x99 response. Paradoxically, stimulating it helps us calm down. The vagus nerve is part of the parasympathetic nervous system, which is associated with calming the body (as opposed to the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the stress response and the release of cortisol and adrenaline).</p>\\n<p>What are some ways to stimulate the vagus nerve when we start to feel overwhelmed? The simplest is to wash your face with cold water. Another way is to sing or hum while meditating.</p>\\n<h5><strong>Get moving! But in a way you enjoy</strong></h5>\\n<p><em>\\xe2\\x80\\x98Have you heard that you should take 10,000 steps a day? Well, there are absolutely no studies that say how many steps are needed,\\xe2\\x80\\x99</em> joked dr Agata Rudnik. <em>\\xe2\\x80\\x98Even if we take 5,000 or 4,000 steps, it\\'s still more than zero.\\xe2\\x80\\x99</em></p>\\n<p>However, movement is important. We need what is known as behavioural activation: doing something makes us feel better. It doesn\\'t have to be anything spectacular. It is worth finding an activity that we enjoy. A good idea might be swimming or walking in the woods, or so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x98forest bathing\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (shinrin yoku), which in Japan is even prescribed by doctors.</p>\\n<h5><strong>Information overload... and misinformation</strong></h5>\\n<p>How to stay up to date and not go crazy? It is worth implementing a few rules.</p>\\n<p><em>\\xe2\\x80\\x98Sometimes we forget to verify the news. We know that there are people in the world who want us to be afraid and worried, because then it is easier to control us,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 </em>said A. Rudnik. <em>\\xe2\\x80\\x98However, from a psychological perspective, I would not say that we should not read anything. It is important to set certain boundaries.\\xe2\\x80\\x99</em></p>\\n<p>So you can set aside time for reading the news (preferably not before bedtime) and remember to verify it.</p>\\n<h5><strong>People give strength</strong></h5>\\n<p>It turns out that valuable social relationships are one of the factors that best protect against bad moods. So, contrary to the urge to \\xe2\\x80\\x98hide in a hole\\xe2\\x80\\x99, it is worth going out to meet people, meeting someone, calling someone you haven\\'t spoken to in a long time. Of course, with the proviso that these are not people who make us feel bad. Each of us also has a slightly different level of \\xe2\\x80\\x98social battery\\xe2\\x80\\x99. Nevertheless, it is worth taking care of relationships.</p>\\n<p><em>\\xe2\\x80\\x98Let\\'s remember that when we hug other people, we release oxytocin, the attachment hormone. And ladies and gentlemen, when we have a deficiency of this hormone (and a deficiency of relationships), the same areas of our brain that are responsible for physical pain are activated. This means that we experience loneliness physiologically.\\xe2\\x80\\x99</em></p>\\n<h5><strong>Seeking help</strong></h5>\\n<p>Evolution, not revolution \\xe2\\x80\\x93 according to the guest of the UG Museum, this is how we should approach self-care. This can also be applied to the change that is taking place in society in terms of attitudes towards therapy and psychological help. While people from the older generation are often reluctant to seek professional help, for younger people it is something completely natural.</p>\\n<p>Interesting fact: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX8TgVR33KM\">film promoting mental health care for men</a></p>\\n<h5><strong>The PERMA model</strong></h5>\\n<p>This model, jokingly presented as a \\xe2\\x80\\x98free\\xe2\\x80\\x99 meeting, was developed by Martin Seligman. It identifies five factors that contribute to life satisfaction. These are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>P - <em>positive emotions</em></li>\\n<li>E - <em>engagement</em></li>\\n<li>R - <em>relationships</em> - being among people, cooperation</li>\\n<li>M - <em>meaning</em>, i.e. a sense of purpose/meaning in what we do</li>\\n<li>A - <em>accomplishment</em></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>What can also help us is the awareness of how much we do for our mental health without even knowing it. It turns out that just reading or listening about mental health makes us feel better.</p>\\n<p><em>\\xe2\\x80\\x98What\\'s more, I\\'ll let you in on a secret: reading about getting rich also makes us feel richer,\\xe2\\x80\\x99</em> joked Agata Rudnik at the end of the meeting. \\xe2\\x80\\x98<em>It\\'s important to remember that!\\xe2\\x80\\x99</em></p>\\n<p>Agata Rudnik was interviewed by <strong>Karolina \\xc5\\xbbuk-Wieczorkiewicz</strong>.</p>\\n</div>\\n      \\n      </div>\\n</div>\\n          </div>\\n  \\n            <div class=\"field field--name-field-autor-txt field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\">CPC UG</div>\\n      \\n      <div class=\"field field--name-field-tagi field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden field__items\">\\n              <div class=\"field__item float-l px-1\"><a href=\"/news/pl/tag/2510/55-lecie-relacje\" hreflang=\"pl\">55-lecie - relacje</a></div>\\n          </div>\\n  \\n  </div>\\n</article>\\n\\n    </div>\\n  </div>\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</section>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</main>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"sidebar col-md-3 offset-md-1\" id=\"sidebar_first\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<aside class=\"section\" role=\"complementary\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  <div class=\"views-element-container p-3 block block-views block-views-blockaktualnosci-podobne-newsy\" id=\"block-views-block-aktualnosci-podobne-newsy\">\\n  \\n      <h2 class=\"border-0 mb-0 mt-0 p-2\">Other news</h2>\\n    \\n      <div class=\"content\">\\n      <div><div class=\"view view-aktualnosci view-id-aktualnosci view-display-id-podobne_newsy js-view-dom-id-0a01c97e89a5d7696d638b46b2bf8a647f105a0bef65049218aef8dc454fa2a4\">\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n      <div class=\"view-content row\">\\n          <div class=\"mb-2 p-2\">\\n    <div>\\n    <div class=\"news-page-img col-12 col-md-12 float-l\"><a href=\"/news/en/8757/world-ug-alumni-reunion-now-behind-us\">  <img src=\"/news/sites/ug.edu.pl.news/files/styles/zdjecie_230x170/public/2025-06/_MG_4077.jpg.webp?itok=DTuiOhbM\" width=\"230\" height=\"170\" alt=\"fot.

How to take care of your emotions in a disturbing reality?‚Äô was the topic of the last meeting of the semester in the series ‚ÄòWhat does science say? (Non-)academic meetings‚Äô at the University of Gda≈Ñsk Museum. What can we do to take care of our well-being? What role do other people play in this, and what about the mysterious vagus nerve? Dr Agata Rudnik, psychologist and director of the Academic Psychological Support Centre at the University of Gda≈Ñsk, talked about ways to deal with difficult emotions in turbulent times.</strong></p>\n",
            "<p>The June meeting in the series ‚ÄòWhat does science say? (Non-)academic meetings‚Äô enjoyed exceptional attendance - additional seats had to be brought into the intimate temporary exhibition hall at the University of Gda≈Ñsk Museum. For some of the guests, this was not their first encounter with science in the form proposed by the UG Museum on the occasion of the university's 55th anniversary. The idea behind the ‚Äò(non)academic meetings‚Äô was to bring science to the people and discuss current, important social issues.</p>\n",
            "<p><em>‚ÄòWe would like to invite you to our discussion, so that it can be a safe space to talk about what is on our minds</em>,‚Äô encouraged <strong>dr Agata Rudnik</strong> at the beginning of the meeting, referring to her own work in a hospital gastroenterology ward.</p>\n",
            "<p>How to cope with a disturbing reality? First of all, it is worth remembering that the various negative emotions and reactions (e.g. anxiety, difficulty sleeping) we experience are completely natural. And what can we do to help ourselves?</p>\n",
            "<h5><strong>Acceptance</strong></h5>\n",
            "<p><em>‚ÄòI feel that we devote a lot of time and energy to fighting something. To be better, smarter, earn more money</em>,‚Äô noted dr Agata Rudnik. Meanwhile, fighting is not always the best choice at a given moment:</p>\n",
            "<p><em>‚ÄòSometimes you have to accept something. We shouldn't fight the fact that sometimes we feel sad or find things difficult, because sometimes we just have to go through it and we need it (...) If we didn't experience stress, we wouldn't even have left the cave. Stress can therefore be motivating and conducive to development - the problem arises when we experience it chronically.‚Äô</em></p>\n",
            "<h5><strong>The intestines, the brain and the mysterious vagus nerve</strong></h5>\n",
            "<p><em>‚ÄòImagine a fluffy kitten. You have as many neurons in your intestines as a cat has in its brain, so you really need to take care of what goes on in there.‚Äô</em></p>\n",
            "<p>It is therefore worth taking care of your microbiome, the ‚Äògood bacteria‚Äô that perform protective functions. How can you do this? It is worth eating fermented foods and going for walks in the forest, because they allow us to absorb beneficial microorganisms from the air.</p>\n",
            "<p>It is also worth remembering the vagus nerve. It is the tenth cranial nerve, which connects the brain to the intestines (among other things) and is responsible for the ‚Äòchill‚Äô response. Paradoxically, stimulating it helps us calm down. The vagus nerve is part of the parasympathetic nervous system, which is associated with calming the body (as opposed to the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the stress response and the release of cortisol and adrenaline).</p>\n",
            "<p>What are some ways to stimulate the vagus nerve when we start to feel overwhelmed? The simplest is to wash your face with cold water. Another way is to sing or hum while meditating.</p>\n",
            "<h5><strong>Get moving! But in a way you enjoy</strong></h5>\n",
            "<p><em>‚ÄòHave you heard that you should take 10,000 steps a day? Well, there are absolutely no studies that say how many steps are needed,‚Äô</em> joked dr Agata Rudnik. <em>‚ÄòEven if we take 5,000 or 4,000 steps, it's still more than zero.‚Äô</em></p>\n",
            "<p>However, movement is important. We need what is known as behavioural activation: doing something makes us feel better. It doesn't have to be anything spectacular. It is worth finding an activity that we enjoy. A good idea might be swimming or walking in the woods, or so-called ‚Äòforest bathing‚Äô (shinrin yoku), which in Japan is even prescribed by doctors.</p>\n",
            "<h5><strong>Information overload... and misinformation</strong></h5>\n",
            "<p>How to stay up to date and not go crazy? It is worth implementing a few rules.</p>\n",
            "<p><em>‚ÄòSometimes we forget to verify the news. We know that there are people in the world who want us to be afraid and worried, because then it is easier to control us,‚Äô </em>said A. Rudnik. <em>‚ÄòHowever, from a psychological perspective, I would not say that we should not read anything. It is important to set certain boundaries.‚Äô</em></p>\n",
            "<p>So you can set aside time for reading the news (preferably not before bedtime) and remember to verify it.</p>\n",
            "<h5><strong>People give strength</strong></h5>\n",
            "<p>It turns out that valuable social relationships are one of the factors that best protect against bad moods. So, contrary to the urge to ‚Äòhide in a hole‚Äô, it is worth going out to meet people, meeting someone, calling someone you haven't spoken to in a long time. Of course, with the proviso that these are not people who make us feel bad. Each of us also has a slightly different level of ‚Äòsocial battery‚Äô. Nevertheless, it is worth taking care of relationships.</p>\n",
            "<p><em>‚ÄòLet's remember that when we hug other people, we release oxytocin, the attachment hormone. And ladies and gentlemen, when we have a deficiency of this hormone (and a deficiency of relationships), the same areas of our brain that are responsible for physical pain are activated. This means that we experience loneliness physiologically.‚Äô</em></p>\n",
            "<h5><strong>Seeking help</strong></h5>\n",
            "<p>Evolution, not revolution ‚Äì according to the guest of the UG Museum, this is how we should approach self-care. This can also be applied to the change that is taking place in society in terms of attitudes towards therapy and psychological help. While people from the older generation are often reluctant to seek professional help, for younger people it is something completely natural.</p>\n",
            "<p>Interesting fact: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX8TgVR33KM\">film promoting mental health care for men</a></p>\n",
            "<h5><strong>The PERMA model</strong></h5>\n",
            "<p>This model, jokingly presented as a ‚Äòfree‚Äô meeting, was developed by Martin Seligman. It identifies five factors that contribute to life satisfaction. These are:</p>\n",
            "<ul>\n",
            "<li>P - <em>positive emotions</em></li>\n",
            "<li>E - <em>engagement</em></li>\n",
            "<li>R - <em>relationships</em> - being among people, cooperation</li>\n",
            "<li>M - <em>meaning</em>, i.e. a sense of purpose/meaning in what we do</li>\n",
            "<li>A - <em>accomplishment</em></li>\n",
            "</ul>\n",
            "<p>What can also help us is the awareness of how much we do for our mental health without even knowing it. It turns out that just reading or listening about mental health makes us feel better.</p>\n",
            "<p><em>‚ÄòWhat's more, I'll let you in on a secret: reading about getting rich also makes us feel richer,‚Äô</em> joked Agata Rudnik at the end of the meeting. ‚Äò<em>It's important to remember that!‚Äô</em></p>\n",

How to take care of your emotions in a disturbing reality?‚Äô was the topic of the last meeting of the semester in the series ‚ÄòWhat does science say? (Non-)academic meetings‚Äô at the University of Gda≈Ñsk Museum. What can we do to take care of our well-being? What role do other people play in this, and what about the mysterious vagus nerve? Dr Agata Rudnik, psychologist and director of the Academic Psychological Support Centre at the University of Gda≈Ñsk, talked about ways to deal with difficult emotions in turbulent times.</strong></p>, <p>The June meeting in the series ‚ÄòWhat does science say? (Non-)academic meetings‚Äô enjoyed exceptional attendance - additional seats had to be brought into the intimate temporary exhibition hall at the University of Gda≈Ñsk Museum. For some of the guests, this was not their first encounter with science in the form proposed by the UG Museum on the occasion of the university's 55th anniversary. The idea behind the ‚Äò(non)academic meetings‚Äô was to bring science to the people and discuss current, important social issues.</p>, <p><em>‚ÄòWe would like to invite you to our discussion, so that it can be a safe space to talk about what is on our minds</em>,‚Äô encouraged <strong>dr Agata Rudnik</strong> at the beginning of the meeting, referring to her own work in a hospital gastroenterology ward.</p>, <p>How to cope with a disturbing reality? First of all, it is worth remembering that the various negative emotions and reactions (e.g. anxiety, difficulty sleeping) we experience are completely natural. And what can we do to help ourselves?</p>, <p><em>‚ÄòI feel that we devote a lot of time and energy to fighting something. To be better, smarter, earn more money</em>,‚Äô noted dr Agata Rudnik. Meanwhile, fighting is not always the best choice at a given moment:</p>, <p><em>‚ÄòSometimes you have to accept something. We shouldn't fight the fact that sometimes we feel sad or find things difficult, because sometimes we just have to go through it and we need it (...) If we didn't experience stress, we wouldn't even have left the cave. Stress can therefore be motivating and conducive to development - the problem arises when we experience it chronically.‚Äô</em></p>, <p><em>‚ÄòImagine a fluffy kitten. You have as many neurons in your intestines as a cat has in its brain, so you really need to take care of what goes on in there.‚Äô</em></p>, <p>It is therefore worth taking care of your microbiome, the ‚Äògood bacteria‚Äô that perform protective functions. How can you do this? It is worth eating fermented foods and going for walks in the forest, because they allow us to absorb beneficial microorganisms from the air.</p>, <p>It is also worth remembering the vagus nerve. It is the tenth cranial nerve, which connects the brain to the intestines (among other things) and is responsible for the ‚Äòchill‚Äô response. Paradoxically, stimulating it helps us calm down. The vagus nerve is part of the parasympathetic nervous system, which is associated with calming the body (as opposed to the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the stress response and the release of cortisol and adrenaline).</p>, <p>What are some ways to stimulate the vagus nerve when we start to feel overwhelmed? The simplest is to wash your face with cold water. Another way is to sing or hum while meditating.</p>, <p><em>‚ÄòHave you heard that you should take 10,000 steps a day? Well, there are absolutely no studies that say how many steps are needed,‚Äô</em> joked dr Agata Rudnik. <em>‚ÄòEven if we take 5,000 or 4,000 steps, it's still more than zero.‚Äô</em></p>, <p>However, movement is important. We need what is known as behavioural activation: doing something makes us feel better. It doesn't have to be anything spectacular. It is worth finding an activity that we enjoy. A good idea might be swimming or walking in the woods, or so-called ‚Äòforest bathing‚Äô (shinrin yoku), which in Japan is even prescribed by doctors.</p>, <p>How to stay up to date and not go crazy? It is worth implementing a few rules.</p>, <p><em>‚ÄòSometimes we forget to verify the news. We know that there are people in the world who want us to be afraid and worried, because then it is easier to control us,‚Äô </em>said A. Rudnik. <em>‚ÄòHowever, from a psychological perspective, I would not say that we should not read anything. It is important to set certain boundaries.‚Äô</em></p>, <p>So you can set aside time for reading the news (preferably not before bedtime) and remember to verify it.</p>, <p>It turns out that valuable social relationships are one of the factors that best protect against bad moods. So, contrary to the urge to ‚Äòhide in a hole‚Äô, it is worth going out to meet people, meeting someone, calling someone you haven't spoken to in a long time. Of course, with the proviso that these are not people who make us feel bad. Each of us also has a slightly different level of ‚Äòsocial battery‚Äô. Nevertheless, it is worth taking care of relationships.</p>, <p><em>‚ÄòLet's remember that when we hug other people, we release oxytocin, the attachment hormone. And ladies and gentlemen, when we have a deficiency of this hormone (and a deficiency of relationships), the same areas of our brain that are responsible for physical pain are activated. This means that we experience loneliness physiologically.‚Äô</em></p>, <p>Evolution, not revolution ‚Äì according to the guest of the UG Museum, this is how we should approach self-care. This can also be applied to the change that is taking place in society in terms of attitudes towards therapy and psychological help. While people from the older generation are often reluctant to seek professional help, for younger people it is something completely natural.</p>, <p>Interesting fact: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX8TgVR33KM\">film promoting mental health care for men</a></p>, <p>This model, jokingly presented as a ‚Äòfree‚Äô meeting, was developed by Martin Seligman. It identifies five factors that contribute to life satisfaction. These are:</p>, <p>What can also help us is the awareness of how much we do for our mental health without even knowing it. It turns out that just reading or listening about mental health makes us feel better.</p>, <p><em>‚ÄòWhat's more, I'll let you in on a secret: reading about getting rich also makes us feel richer,‚Äô</em> joked Agata Rudnik at the end of the meeting. ‚Äò<em>It's important to remember that!‚Äô</em></p>, <p>Agata Rudnik was interviewed by <strong>Karolina ≈ªuk-Wieczorkiewicz</strong>.</p>, <p><a href=\"https://bip.ug.edu.pl\"><img alt=\"Logo BIP\" class=\"bip-icon\" src=\"/news/sites/ug.edu.pl.news/themes/barrio_news/img/bip.svg\"/></a></p>, <p class=\"social-icons\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UniwersytetGdanski\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Logo Facebook\" src=\"/news/sites/ug.edu.pl.news/themes/barrio_news/img/fb.png\"/> </a></p>, <p class=\"social-icons\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/uniwersytet_gd\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Logo Twitter\" src=\"/news/sites/ug.edu.pl.news/themes/barrio_news/img/twitter.png\"/> </a></p>, <p class=\"social-icons\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/uniwersytet_gdanski/\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Logo Instagram\" src=\"/news/sites/ug.edu.pl.news/themes/barrio_news/img/instagram.png\"/> </a></p>, <p class=\"social-icons\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT33GT7flsO-3rqoeao3hzg\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Logo Youtube\" src=\"/news/sites/ug.edu.pl.news/themes/barrio_news/img/yt.png\"/> </a></p>]\n"

Dr Agata Rudnik, psychologist and director of the Academic Psychological Support Centre at the University of Gda≈Ñsk, talked about ways to deal with difficult emotions in turbulent times.\n",

For some of the guests, this was not their first encounter with science in the form proposed by the UG Museum on the occasion of the university's 55th anniversary. The idea behind the ‚Äò(non)academic meetings‚Äô was to bring science to the people and discuss current, important social issues.\n",
            "‚ÄòWe would like to invite you to our discussion, so that it can be a safe space to talk about what is on our minds,‚Äô encouraged dr Agata Rudnik at the beginning of the meeting, referring to her own work in a hospital gastroenterology ward.\n",

            "It is also worth remembering the vagus nerve.
